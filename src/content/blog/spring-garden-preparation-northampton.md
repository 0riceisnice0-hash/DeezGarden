As the days get longer and temperatures start to rise, spring is the perfect time to prepare your garden for the growing season ahead. Here in Northampton, our gardens benefit from the fertile Northamptonshire soil, but they still need proper care to look their best.

## Why Spring Garden Preparation Matters

Spring garden preparation sets the foundation for a beautiful garden throughout the year. By taking the time to properly prepare your outdoor space, you'll enjoy healthier plants, a lusher lawn, and fewer problems with pests and diseases.

## Essential Spring Garden Tasks

### 1. Clear Winter Debris

Start by clearing away any leaves, branches, and debris that accumulated over winter. This prevents disease and pests while allowing sunlight to reach emerging plants. In Northampton, we often see a build-up of leaf litter in sheltered spots that needs clearing.

### 2. Lawn Care

Your lawn needs attention after the winter months:

- **Rake** the lawn to remove dead grass and moss
- **Aerate** compacted areas to improve drainage
- **Apply** a spring lawn feed to encourage growth
- **Overseed** any bare patches

March and April are ideal months for lawn renovation work in our Northamptonshire climate.

### 3. Prune and Trim

Late winter and early spring are perfect for pruning many shrubs and trees:

- Prune roses before new growth starts
- Trim summer-flowering shrubs
- Cut back ornamental grasses
- Remove any dead or damaged branches

Be careful with spring-flowering shrubs like forsythia – prune these after they've bloomed.

### 4. Soil Preparation

Prepare borders and beds for planting:

- Remove weeds that have established over winter
- Add organic matter like compost or well-rotted manure
- Lightly fork over the soil without disturbing plant roots
- Apply a layer of mulch to suppress weeds and retain moisture

Northampton's clay soil particularly benefits from organic matter to improve drainage and structure.

### 5. Plan Your Planting

Consider what you want to grow this year:

- **Vegetables**: Plan your vegetable garden and start seeds indoors
- **Flowers**: Choose bedding plants and perennials
- **Bulbs**: Plant summer-flowering bulbs like dahlias and gladioli
- **Herbs**: Start an herb garden in a sunny spot

## When to Start in Northampton

In Northampton and across Northamptonshire, the ideal time to start spring preparation is typically late February through March, once the worst of the winter weather has passed and the soil begins to warm up. However, always check weather forecasts – avoid working on waterlogged soil or when frost is forecast.
